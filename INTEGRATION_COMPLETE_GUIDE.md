## 🎯 How It All Works Together

```
SALES REP WORKFLOW:
==================

1. Rep opens http://localhost:3000
   └─ Sees dashboard with 887K HCPs
   
2. Rep searches for HCP (e.g., "Smith", NPI, specialty)
   └─ Filters by tier, territory, TRx
   
3. Rep clicks on HCP name
   └─ Opens HCP detail page with 3 tabs:
      • Overview & Insights (ML predictions, charts)
      • 🤖 AI Call Script (NEW!)
      • Call History (placeholder)
   
4. Rep clicks "🤖 AI Call Script" tab
   └─ Shows Call Script Generator component
   
5. Rep clicks "Generate with AI Enhancement" button
   └─ Frontend sends POST request to FastAPI
   └─ Backend:
       1. Loads HCP data (TRx, specialty, tier, trends)
       2. Runs 9 ML models for predictions
       3. Selects appropriate scenario (RETENTION/GROWTH/etc.)
       4. Retrieves MLR-approved content from library (17 pieces)
       5. Uses GPT-4o-mini to personalize verbiage
       6. Runs compliance check (41 prohibited terms)
       7. Returns complete script + compliance report
   
6. Frontend displays script with sections:
   └─ Opening
   └─ Talking Points (3-5 with MLR IDs)
   └─ Objection Handlers
   └─ Call to Action
   └─ Next Steps
   └─ Required Disclaimers
   └─ MLR Content Used
   
7. Rep can:
   └─ Copy to clipboard
   └─ Download as .txt file
   └─ Regenerate with different approach
   └─ Edit and customize
   
8. Rep uses script during call
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Verify Backend**
1. Open: http://localhost:8000/docs

3. Should see: `{"status": "healthy", "models_loaded": 9}`

### **Step 2: Test API Directly**
1. Click "POST /generate-call-script"
2. Click "Try it out"
3. Enter:
   ```json
   {
     "hcp_id": "12345",
     "include_gpt4": false
   }
   ```
4. Add header: `X-API-Key: ibsa-ai-script-generator-2025`
5. Click "Execute"
6. Should get 200 response with complete script

### **Step 3: Test UI Integration**
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Search for any HCP (e.g., type "Smith" in search box)
3. Click on HCP name to open detail page
4. Click "🤖 AI Call Script" tab
5. Click "Generate with AI Enhancement" button
6. Wait 5-10 seconds
7. Should see:
   - ✅ Compliance Status (green checkmark)
   - Complete script with all sections
   - Copy/Download buttons working

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"Cannot connect to FastAPI"**
**Problem:** UI shows connection error  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check if FastAPI is running
Get-Process python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# If not running, start it
python start_api.py
```

---

### **"Models not loaded"**
**Problem:** `/health` shows `models_loaded: 0`  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check models exist
ls "ibsa-poc-eda/outputs/models/trained_models/*.pkl"

# Should see 9 .pkl files
# If missing, retrain:
python phase6_model_training.py
```

---

### **"FAISS index not found"**
**Problem:** Script generation fails with FAISS error  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Rebuild FAISS index
python phase6d_rag_gpt4_script_generator.py
```

---

### **"Compliance content missing"**
**Problem:** Script has no content  
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Regenerate compliance library
python phase6b_compliance_content_library.py
```

---

### **"UI not loading"**
**Problem:** http://localhost:3000 shows error  
**Solution:**
```powershell
cd ibsa_precall_ui

# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -r .next
npm run build
npm run dev
```
