## Phase 3: EDA Slide Enhancements

### 1. **Decile Analysis (Pareto 80/20)**
**Pharma Insight Added**:
- Top 20% (Deciles 1-2) generate 82.5% of prescriptions → validates premium resource targeting
- Middle deciles (3-5) = "movable middle" with established practice patterns
- Bottom deciles need cost-efficient digital/remote strategies (not high-touch field)

### 2. **HCP Segmentation (Pharma Standard Segments)**
**Strategy Context Added**:
- Stars & Potentials (15%) = acquisition opportunity (early adopters)
- Core (31%) = protect & maintain with loyalty programs
- Occasional (42%) = movable middle needing call frequency optimization
- Dormant (12%) = win-back with competitive messaging
- Drives differentiated call plans and resource allocation by territory

### 3. **Competitive Positioning**
**Competitive Dynamics Explained**:
- 93.6% IBSA-dominant among prescribers = high loyalty, not a "leaky bucket"
- 722 at-risk HCPs declining = urgent retention programs needed
- 285 opportunity HCPs = low IBSA share but high volume (competitive displacement target)
- Focus: Tirosint bioavailability advantage vs generic levothyroxine

### 4. **Market Share Distribution**
**Prescriber Loyalty Analysis**:
- 92.2% avg wallet share, 100% median = "sticky" prescribing once converted
- 68.3% of ALL HCPs <25% IBSA share = 151K untapped prescribers
- Strategic implication: Products work clinically (drive loyalty) but need awareness building
- Tactic: Peer-to-peer programs, thought leader endorsements, clinical evidence

### 5. **Sample ROI (Black Holes)**
**Sample Effectiveness Explained**:
- Black holes (48.5%, 12,324 HCPs) = accept samples but ZERO Rx conversion
- High-ROI (18.5%, 4,699 HCPs) = convert to >10 TRx each
- Root cause: Samples without patient ID, lack of follow-up, prescriber inertia
- Action: "Samples-for-scripts" program, redirect 60% of waste to high-ROI
- Potential: +$2M revenue from same sample budget

### 6. **Call Effectiveness (Reach & Frequency)**
**Field Force Strategy**:
- 98.6% unreached (zero face-to-face) = white space opportunity
- L&L programs: 90% Rx lift vs office calls (extended engagement + peer influence)
- Scale L&L 3-5x in Endo/IM practices
- Optimal frequency: 4-6 touches/qtr for actives, 2-3 for acquisition
- Remote detailing for Tier 3 HCPs (cost-efficient)

### 7. **Prescription Velocity & Momentum**
**Temporal Dynamics Explained**:
- 4,642 lapsed writers = previously active, now stopped (velocity negative)
- Revenue impact: ~$2M lost annualized
- Root causes: Formulary changes, competitive wins, patient switching, practice shifts
- Intervention: 90-day win-back window with competitive objection handling
- Temporal lag features (3/6/12-month) enable proactive prevention
- Priority: Endo lapsed writers (35% recovery rate)

### 8. **Specialty Performance Analysis**
**Clinical Alignment Strategy**:
- Endo (47.2 TRx/HCP) & Rheum (28.6 TRx/HCP) = category experts with deep knowledge
- Drive 60% of IBSA volume despite being only 8% of prescriber base
- Family Medicine (6.8 TRx/HCP) = volume opportunity, needs simplified messaging
- Internal Medicine (12.4 TRx/HCP) = movable middle with clinical sophistication
- Resource allocation: Prioritize Endo for Tirosint, Rheum for Flector, FM for portfolio

### 9. **Payer Distribution**
**Market Access Intelligence**:
- 99.96% commercial coverage = favorable (better reimbursement, fewer PA barriers)
- Vulnerability: If payers move to non-preferred tier or add step therapy
- Strategy: Maintain PBM relationships, monitor formulary changes quarterly
- Deploy copay assistance for >$60 out-of-pocket scenarios
- 8,729 HCPs with detailed payer data = targeted access support

### 10. **Territory Intelligence (Top & Bottom)**
**Execution Excellence Analysis**:
- 10x performance gap (7.9 TRx/HCP top vs 0.79 bottom) = execution, not market potential
- Top performer behaviors: High L&L frequency (2-3x), specialty focus, 5-6 touches/qtr, competitive messaging
- Bottom performers: 70%+ unreached, inefficient routing, reactive planning
- Action: Deploy playbooks via ride-alongs, call plan audits, coaching
- Potential: +$5M from closing half the gap
- UnAssigned territory (5,393 HCPs) = greenfield expansion

### 11. **Product Performance Comparison**
**Portfolio Dynamics**:
- Synthroid/Levothyroxine: 2.2M TRx (319K HCPs) = 95% of thyroid market (primary threat)
- Tirosint positioning: Premium alternative for absorption issues, ingredient sensitivity, inadequate TSH control
- Flector: Topical NSAID avoids GI/CV risks of oral NSAIDs (Rheum, Ortho, Sports Med focus)
- Licart: Niche cardiology/angina product
- Cross-portfolio: Endos managing diabetic neuropathy = Flector opportunity

## Wallet Share & Competitive Intelligence (5 New Slides)

### 1. **Executive Summary Dashboard**
**Market Reality Explained**:
- 30,760 HCPs (13.9%) prescribe IBSA = LOW penetration despite 87% wallet share
- "Sticky" products (high satisfaction) but limited awareness/trial
- 98K TRx addressable (15% conversion assumption from competitor base)
- Strategic shift: From share defense → aggressive new prescriber acquisition
- ROI: Each 1% penetration = +$1.2M revenue
- Focus: First-time prescriber programs with peer endorsements

### 2. **HCP Segmentation by Wallet Share Tier**
**Tier-Based Strategy**:
- Retention tier (70-100%, 25,895 HCPs) = 89% of volume (103K TRx) → loyalty programs only
- Growth opportunity in lower tiers:
  - Conversion (0-10%, 1,536 HCPs)
  - Growth (10-30%, 2,027 HCPs)
  - Expansion (30-50%, 865 HCPs)
- Collectively: 9K current TRx but 97K addressable from their competitor volume
- Strategic implication: STOP over-investing in 70%+ loyalty. Redirect to "movable middle" (10-50%)
- Non-prescribers (190K) need awareness building first

### 3. **Competitive Landscape Analysis**
**Market Structure**:
- IBSA 15% vs Competitors 85% = NOT dominant market position
- Competitor segmentation:
  - **Competitor-Dominant** (>70% comp share) = HIGH PRIORITY → aggressive comparative claims, case studies
  - **Competitor-Strong** (50-70%) = MEDIUM PRIORITY → clinical evidence, copay support
  - **Competitor-Weak** (<50%) = QUICK WINS → consistent engagement
- Product mix: Synthroid/Levo = 95% of competitor thyroid TRx
- Messaging focus: TSH control consistency, absorption reliability, inactive ingredient issues with generics

### 4. **Growth Potential Analysis**
**Systematic Cultivation**:
- 86.6% (191K HCPs) = MEDIUM growth (5-10 percentage point increase achievable in 12 months)
- NOT high-flyers but realistic, systematic opportunity
- Growth drivers: 4-6 quarterly calls, clinical evidence, patient starter programs, objection handling
- Conservative capture: 15% of competitor TRx (98K scripts) = $4.9M incremental
- High-growth HCPs (>10 points, 16K HCPs) = intensive "surround sound" (speakers, advisory boards, peer influence)
- Low-growth (<5 points, 10K HCPs) = remote/digital only

### 5. **Product-Specific Wallet Share**
**Portfolio Dynamics**:
- **TIROSINT** (Thyroid):
  - High penetration among Endos (47.2 TRx/HCP) but concentrated in high-loyalty
  - Opportunity: Expand to IM/FM with simplified positioning ("better absorption than generic")
- **FLECTOR** (Pain/NSAID):
  - Moderate penetration, broader distribution
  - Awareness play: Wide sampling in Rheum, Ortho, Sports Med
  - Messaging: Topical = avoids GI/CV risks of oral NSAIDs
- **LICART** (Cardiology/Nitrates):
  - Niche, low penetration
  - Requires targeted Cardiology focus with angina clinical data
- **Cross-portfolio**: Endos managing diabetic neuropathy (Flector indication) = train reps on portfolio selling
