# RAG Knowledge Base - Complete Inventory

## 📚 Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system has access to **14 MLR/CRC-approved content pieces** stored in a FAISS vector index. Every piece of content has:
- ✅ MLR/CRC approval ID
- ✅ Approval date & expiration
- ✅ Reviewer information
- ✅ Semantic embeddings for vector search

## 🔍 How RAG Works

```
User Query: "Tell me about Tirosint for patients with malabsorption"
         ↓
[Sentence Transformer] → Converts query to 384-dim vector
         ↓
[FAISS Vector Search] → Finds top 5 most similar content pieces
         ↓
[Retrieved Content] → Returns MLR-approved content with IDs
         ↓
[GPT-4 Enhancement] → Uses ONLY retrieved content to personalize
         ↓
[Compliance Check] → Validates final output
         ↓
[Generated Script] → 100% compliant, fully traceable
```

**Key Advantage:** The system CANNOT hallucinate claims because it only uses pre-approved content from the index!

2. Receive MLR-2024-XXX-XXX approval ID
3. Document approval date, expiration, reviewer

### Step 2: Add to Compliance Library
```python
new_content = {
    "content_id": "TIR-CLI-003",
    "category": "clinical_claims",
    "product": "Tirosint",
    "title": "New Study Title",
    "content": "MLR-approved verbiage here...",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "approval": {
        "approval_id": "MLR-2024-TIR-007",
        "approved_by": "MLR",
        "approval_date": "2025-11-15",
        "expires_at": "2026-11-15",
        "version": "1.0",
        "reviewer_name": "Dr. John Doe",
        "reviewer_email": "john.doe@ibsa.com"
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Rebuild FAISS Index
```bash
python phase6d_rag_gpt4_script_generator.py
```
The system automatically:
- Generates embeddings for new content
- Updates FAISS index
- Maintains version control
- Preserves existing content

### Step 4: Test Retrieval
Query the new content to verify it's retrievable and returns correct MLR ID.

## 🎯 Real-World RAG Example

**Scenario:** Rep preparing for call with endocrinologist who has patients with Celiac disease

**Query to RAG:** *"Tirosint for patients with malabsorption issues"*

**RAG Retrieval (Top 3):**
1. **TIR-CLI-002** (Malabsorption Study) - 0.92 similarity score
   - Content about GI absorption, Celiac-relevant
   - Includes peer-reviewed citation
   
2. **TIR-MSG-001** (Gel Cap Advantage) - 0.87 similarity score
   - 4-ingredient formulation
   - Excipient sensitivity benefits
   
3. **TIR-SAF-001** (Contraindications) - 0.65 similarity score
   - Safety information for fair balance
   - Required for compliant discussion

**GPT-4 Enhancement:**
Takes these 3 pieces and creates a natural conversation:
> "Dr. Smith, I know you see a lot of patients with Celiac disease in your practice. For those patients, Tirosint's simple 4-ingredient formulation can be really helpful. A 2014 study published in the European Journal of Endocrinology showed that patients with GI malabsorption had more consistent levothyroxine levels on Tirosint compared to standard tablets. [Safety info follows...]"

**Compliance Check:**
✅ All claims traced to MLR IDs (TIR-CLI-002, TIR-MSG-001, TIR-SAF-001)
