I don't have the ability to view or access files directly, including Jupyter notebooks. However, I can help you replicate the modules and provide guidance based on the content you describe or share from the notebook. 

If you can provide details about the specific modules, functions, or analyses included in `IBSA_PoC_EDA.ipynb`, I can help you write the equivalent Python code or provide explanations for each part. Please share the relevant sections or describe what you need assistance with!
