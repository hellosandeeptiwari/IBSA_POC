I don't have the capability to view or access files directly, including Jupyter notebooks. However, I can help you replicate the modules and functionality typically found in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook based on common practices and libraries used in Python.

If you can provide me with a summary of the modules or specific sections from the `IBSA_PoC_EDA.ipynb` notebook, I can help you write the corresponding Python code. Here are some common components of an EDA notebook that you might want to include:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.

2. **Loading Data**: Load your dataset using pandas.

3. **Data Overview**: Display the first few rows of the dataset, check for missing values, and get a summary of the dataset.

4. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to understand the distribution of variables, relationships between variables, etc.

5. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform basic statistical analysis, such as correlation matrices, descriptive statistics, etc.

6. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or modify existing ones based on insights from the data.

7. **Handling Missing Values**: Strategies for dealing with missing data.

8. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.

9. **Data Transformation**: Normalize or standardize data if necessary.

10. **Saving Processed Data**: Save the cleaned and processed data for further analysis or modeling.

If you provide specific details or sections from your notebook, I can help you write the code for those parts!
