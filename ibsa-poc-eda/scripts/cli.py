It seems that you are referring to a specific Jupyter notebook file named `IBSA_PoC_EDA.ipynb`, but I don't have the capability to access or view files directly. However, I can help you replicate the modules and functionality typically found in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook based on common practices.

To assist you better, please provide a brief description of the modules or sections in the notebook that you would like to replicate. Here are some common components of an EDA notebook that you might want to include:

1. **Data Loading**: Loading datasets using libraries like pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data types.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Generating summary statistics and visualizations.
4. **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual analysis.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing relationships between variables.
6. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on existing data.
7. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling outliers in the dataset.

If you can provide more details about the specific modules or analyses you want to replicate, I can help you write the corresponding Python code or provide guidance on how to implement those features.
