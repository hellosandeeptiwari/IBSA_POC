It seems that you are referring to a specific Jupyter notebook file named `IBSA_PoC_EDA.ipynb`, but I don't have the capability to access files or attachments directly. However, I can help you replicate the modules and functionalities typically found in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook.

To assist you better, please provide a brief description of the modules or functionalities you want to replicate. Common components of an EDA notebook might include:

1. **Data Loading**: Reading data from CSV, Excel, or databases.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data types.
3. **Data Visualization**: Creating plots using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Summary statistics, correlations, and hypothesis testing.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones.
6. **Modeling**: If applicable, building and evaluating machine learning models.

If you can specify the modules or sections you want to replicate, I can provide you with code snippets and explanations for each part.
