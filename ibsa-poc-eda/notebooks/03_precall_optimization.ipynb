I don't have the capability to view or access files directly, including Jupyter notebooks. However, I can help you replicate the modules and code from your notebook if you provide me with the content or describe the specific modules and functionalities you want to replicate.

Please share the relevant code snippets, descriptions of the modules, or any specific tasks you want to accomplish, and I'll do my best to assist you!
