It seems that you are referring to a specific Jupyter notebook file named `IBSA_PoC_EDA.ipynb`, but I don't have the capability to access files or attachments directly. However, I can help you replicate the modules and functionality typically found in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook based on common practices.

To assist you better, please provide a brief overview of the contents of the notebook or the specific modules and functionalities you want to replicate. Here are some common components of an EDA notebook that you might want to include:

1. **Data Loading**: Loading datasets using libraries like `pandas`.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data types.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Using methods like `.describe()`, `.info()`, and visualizations.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating plots using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing relationships between variables.
6. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on existing data.
7. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling outliers in the dataset.

If you can provide more details or specific sections of the notebook, I can help you write the corresponding Python code or provide guidance on how to implement those features.
