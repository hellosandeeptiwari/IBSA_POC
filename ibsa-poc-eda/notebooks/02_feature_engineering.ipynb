I don't have the capability to view or access files directly, including Jupyter notebooks. However, I can help you replicate the modules and functionality typically found in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook based on common practices and libraries used in Python.

If you can provide me with a summary of the modules or specific sections from your `IBSA_PoC_EDA.ipynb` notebook, I can help you write the corresponding Python code. Here are some common components of an EDA notebook that you might want to replicate:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Common libraries include `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

2. **Loading Data**: Code to load datasets, typically using `pandas`.

3. **Data Overview**: Functions to display the first few rows of the dataset, summary statistics, and data types.

4. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.

5. **Data Visualization**: Creating plots to visualize distributions, relationships, and trends in the data.

6. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones based on insights from the data.

7. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing correlations between features, often visualized with heatmaps.

8. **Categorical Data Analysis**: Analyzing and visualizing categorical variables.

9. **Numerical Data Analysis**: Analyzing and visualizing numerical variables.

10. **Conclusion and Insights**: Summarizing findings and potential next steps.

If you provide specific details or sections from your notebook, I can help you write the code for those parts!
