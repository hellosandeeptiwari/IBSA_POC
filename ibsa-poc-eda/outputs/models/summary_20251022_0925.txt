KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. NGD (New/Grower/Decliner) Classification:
   ✓ Included as 'ngd_decile' target (Model 4)
   ✓ Also embedded in 'hcp_segment' (Model 7)
   ✓ NGD momentum features used throughout

2. Model Stacking (Predictions as Features):
   ✓ Implemented in Model 9 (Master Ensemble)
   ✓ Uses predictions from Models 1-8 as meta-features
   ✓ Demonstrates ensemble learning capability

3. Production Deployment:
   ✓ All models saved as .pkl files
   ✓ Can be loaded with: pickle.load(open(file, 'rb'))
   ✓ Ready for API integration
