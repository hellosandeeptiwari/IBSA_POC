TARGET VARIABLES (REAL OUTCOMES ONLY - NO SYNTHETIC)
================================================================================

1. CALL_SUCCESS (Binary Classification) - REAL OUTCOMES
   Definition: HCP showed positive TRx growth
   Type: Binary (0/1) + Continuous Score (0-1)
   Data Source: Prescriber Overview - Real TRx(Current) > TRx(Previous)
   Valid HCPs: 346,508
   Success Rate: 33.93%
   Successful: 117557 HCPs

2. PRESCRIPTION_LIFT (Regression) - REAL OUTCOMES
   Definition: Actual TRx change from previous to current quarter
   Type: Continuous (can be negative)
   Data Source: Prescriber Overview - TRx(Current) - TRx(Previous)
   Valid HCPs: 346,508
   Mean: -0.04 TRx
   Median: 0.00 TRx
   Range: [-4.25, 4.00]
   Positive Lift: 117,557 HCPs (33.9%)

3. NGD_CLASSIFICATION (Multi-class) - REAL OUTCOMES
   Definition: Industry-standard New/Growth/Decline/Stable classification
   Type: Multi-class (0=Stable, 1=New, 2=Growth, 3=Decline)
   Data Source: Prescriber Overview - Real TRx changes with ±20% thresholds
   Valid HCPs: 346,508
   Distribution:
     STABLE    :  170,541 ( 49.2%)
     NEW       :   41,729 ( 12.0%)
     GROWTH    :   43,970 ( 12.7%)
     DECLINE   :   90,268 ( 26.1%)

  Total Records: 1,313,396
  Total Columns: 100
  Clean Features: 91
  Targets: 8

WHY ONLY 3 TARGETS (NOT 8):
  - REMOVED all synthetic/formula-based targets
  - Sample Effectiveness: Calculated FROM trx_current = R-squared 1.0 (circular logic)
  - Old NGD Score: Used same features it predicts = R-squared 1.0 (data leakage)
  - Churn Risk: Used retention_probability feature = R-squared 1.0 (leakage)
  - Future TRx: Formula-based = R-squared 0.9998 (no real prediction)
  - HCP Segment: Rule-based bucketing = R-squared 1.0 (deterministic)
  - Expected ROI: Formula from future_trx = R-squared 0.9998 (derivative)

BENEFITS OF REAL OUTCOMES APPROACH:
  1. NO data leakage - all targets independent of features
  2. Realistic R² scores (0.30-0.60) instead of perfect 1.0
  3. Defensible to regulators/leadership
  4. Predictions based on REAL historical patterns
  5. Trust from sales reps - not 'too good to be true'
  6. NGD is PRIMARY model using predictions from Models 1-2 as features
